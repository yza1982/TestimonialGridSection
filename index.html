            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incedibly fun! I enrolled short ly thereafter. The next 12
            weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

            " Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple pffers. 100% recommend!"
